# Self-Improving AI Agent 🚀  

A dynamic AI agent that autonomously identifies knowledge gaps, retrieves relevant information, and adapts its learning over time using **Adaptive Learning Strategies**.

## 🌟 Features  

- **Knowledge Gap Detection**: Identifies missing keywords and semantic gaps in retrieved information.  
- **Dynamic Query Refinement**: Improves query formation based on past retrieval performance.  
- **Memory & Retention**: Stores past learnings to avoid redundant knowledge acquisition.  
- **Feedback Mechanism**: Adapts based on past successful and failed queries.  
- **Wikipedia Integration**: Retrieves knowledge from Wikipedia dynamically.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup  

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/self-improving-ai-agent.git
cd self-improving-ai-agent
```

### 2️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment & Install Dependencies  
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Run the AI Learning Agent  
```bash
python src/test_learning_loop.py
```

## 📖 How It Works  

1. The **learning_loop.py** script starts an infinite learning cycle.  
2. It dynamically **generates queries** based on past knowledge gaps.  
3. The agent retrieves **relevant information from Wikipedia**.  
4. It **detects missing knowledge** using lexical and semantic gap analysis.  
5. The AI **refines its learning** by improving weak queries.  
6. Knowledge is **stored and reused** to prevent redundant queries.  
7. A **feedback mechanism** helps the AI track and improve its knowledge acquisition.  

## 📊 Example Output  

```
🔍 Identifying knowledge gaps...
Query: "What is Transfer Learning?"
⚠️ Knowledge Gaps Detected: ['fine-tuning', 'domain adaptation']
📚 Learning new concepts: {'fine-tuning': 'Transfer learning fine-tunes pre-trained models...', 'domain adaptation': 'A technique used when target and source domains differ...'}
✅ No gaps detected. AI knowledge is up-to-date.
⏳ Waiting 30 seconds before next cycle...
```

## 🔥 Future Enhancements  

- **Multi-source knowledge retrieval** (Google, Arxiv, etc.)  
- **Advanced reinforcement learning** for query improvement  
- **Custom dataset integration** for domain-specific knowledge
